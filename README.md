# Overview

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of Recurrent neural Networks (RNN). These kind of networks process sequential data, it learns the input data by iterating a sequence of elements and acquires the state information regarding the observed part of the elements. You can use them in order to predict the fluctuation of the stock's market.
This code performs an analysis about Tesla's historical data to understand directional stock movements.

This is only a silly example, I am going to work further on it.
